            <p> To protect yourself and others: By reporting a phishing attack, you can help to protect yourself and others from falling victim to the attack. The sooner the attack is reported, the sooner it can be stopped and the less damage it can cause.To help improve cybersecurity defenses: By reporting a phishing attack, you help organizations improve their cybersecurity defenses.</p>
            <p> Be suspicious of emails or text messages that ask for personal information: Phishing emails and text messages often ask for personal information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or Social Security numbers. If you receive an email or text message that asks for this type of information, be suspicious and do not respond.</p>
            <p> An organization can never have perfect security, but it can become resilient to security attacks. Like we are never perfectly immune to all health and safety risks in the physical world, the data and information systems we operate are also never 100 percent safe from all attacks all the time.</p>
            <p> Check the sender's email address: Phishing emails often come from addresses that look like they are from legitimate organizations. However, if you hover over the sender's email address, you can often see the real address. If the email address does not look legitimate, do not respond.</p>
